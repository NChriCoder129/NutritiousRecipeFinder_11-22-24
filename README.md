# My SciFair Source Code

Hello everyone! This was the source code I used for my revised solution trials (11/22/24). I have since made many updates to my project and this is somewhat outdated to what I currently have for my project, even considering the interview. The reason why there are so many files is because I never bothered to organize them, which in hindsight I really should've done. I have a lot of "commented-out code" due to my bad organization as well. I tried to remove a decent amount of it when doing my trials but I'm sure there's still a lot. I also annotated to show marks of my progress over the months and to help increase my understanding (and the understanding of any viewers who see it) of the code. Either way, I'm glad I was able to get this much done considering I was behind for most of the project, and no matter what I'm proud of what I've achieved through my work. The file with the majority of code is "main.py", as that's where the main process of the code is, although the "index.html" and "style.css" pages are also vital to the project. Have a great day everyone, and stay blessed.

I created the source code by myself (Nicholas Soo), but I used ChatGPT (artificial intelligence) whenever necessary to guide me through coding. I only used ChatGPT when it was necessary to.
