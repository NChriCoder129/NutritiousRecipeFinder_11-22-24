# My SciFair Source Code

Hello everyone! This was the source code I used for my revised solution trials (11/22/24). I have since made many updates to my project and this is somewhat outdated to what I currently have for my project, even considering the interview. The reason why there are so many files is because I never bothered to organize them, which in hindsight I really should've done. Either way, I'm glad I was able to get this much done considering I was behind for most of the project, and no matter what I'm proud of what I've achieved through my work. Have a great day everyone, and stay blessed.
